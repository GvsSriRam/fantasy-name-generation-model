# text-generation-models
A repo for my fun works on text generation using ML

## Fantasy Name Generation
Very often I struggle wth finding a catchy name for my online gamer identity and ran into this tutorial on coursera. This is a part of a guided project.

### Work Done
- Created a keras tokenizer to parse the text dataset containing super hero names
- Generated training and validation datasets by using the tokenizer character indices
- Created and trained a text generation model using primarily Convolution 1D layer and LTSM layers
- Achieved an accuracy of 35%, can be improved with fine-tuning
- Created prediction function to generate name based on input prompt
